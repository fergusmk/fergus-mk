On July 4-7 2023, I, together with research partner Hank Luo, attended the the 30th EG-ICE: International Conference on Intelligent Computing in Engineering to present my conference paper on my research project on using computer vision techniques to detect road defects on multiple input modalities. The paper discussed the strengths and weaknesses of various data input modalities in capturing features of road defects, such as potholes and cracks.
