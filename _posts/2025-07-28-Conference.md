On July 29 2025, I attended the ISARC 2025 (The International Association for Automation and Robotics in Construction) conference in Montreal, where I presented a conference paper on exploring low-resource fine-tuning based technical text classifiation using LLMs such as Mistral and LLama.

This papers compared fine-tuned LLMs to a popular, dedicated few-shot classifier (SetFit). It highlights that in low resource settings, particularly in a complex domain-specific text classification task, LLMs still leave a lot to be desired!
