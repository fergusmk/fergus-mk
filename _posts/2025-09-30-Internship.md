title: "MLE internship completed!"

I just completed my 6-month internship at Viridien as a Machine Learning Engineer! Had the pleasure of working with such a great and talented team.

During the internship, I worked on a very exciting project on agentic database information retrieval (Text2SQL / RAG). First, I engineered various features to embed more than 400 tables to link relevant schemas to a query. Then, I created an MCP server to allow a custom-built agentic AI pipeline (made with Camel) to retrieve and review the information extracted. The final product was a chatbot that can query a database and answer questions!

Having this short break away from academia, I learned a lot about industry practices in ML, such as LLM deployment with vLLM, docker, HPCs, and CI/CD, which complements my main doctoral research well!
