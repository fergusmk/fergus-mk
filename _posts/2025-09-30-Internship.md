title: "MLE Internship Completed!"
---

I just completed my 6-month internship at Viridien as a Machine Learning Engineer! Had the pleasure of working with such a great and talented team.

During the internship, I worked on a very exciting project on agentic database information retrieval (Text2SQL). This involved feature engineering to embed the more than 400 tables present to shortlist relevant tables and columns. Then, I created an MCP server to allow a custom built AI Agent pipeline (using Camel) to retrieve and review the information extracted. The final product was a chatbot that can query a database and answer questions!

Having this short break away from academia, I learned a lot about industry practices in ML, such as LLM deployment with vLLM, docker, HPCs, and CI/CD, which complements my main doctoral research well!
