title: Traffic Sign Attribute and Defect Identification (Ongoing)
description: Identifying traffic sign attributes and defects using real world data, with a focus on data-efficiency.
---
A research project about identifying the attributes and defects present on traffic signs. This is actually a surprisingly complex task, as there are so many variations. The focus is once again on data-efficiency, extending on the problem identified in the technical text classification project.

Still ongoing...
