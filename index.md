Greetings! I am Fergus (aka Ching Yau), a PhD student at the University of Cambridge.

I studied Information and Computer Engineering at the Cambridge Engineering Department, and am now a postgraduate student at the Civil Engineering Department researching data-efficient AI applications in the field. You can read more about my work here on my website!

I am interested in using machine learning for applications that can benefit society. To show my dedication, I stood on the streets of Cambridgeshire for a week in February, collecting 3D scans of potholes with a laser scanner. What a lovely field activity indeed!
