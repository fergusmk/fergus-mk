Greetings! I am Fergus (aka Ching Yau), a PhD student at the University of Cambridge.

I studied Information and Computer Engineering at the Cambridge Engineering Department, and am now a postgraduate student at the Civil Engineering Department. 

I am interested in researching about engineering applications of machine learning. Having focused on Computer Vision in the past, my focus is now on Natural Language Processing, which is also my PhD research area!

To show my dedication, I stood on the streets of Cambridgeshire for a week in February, collecting 3D scans of potholes with a laser scanner. What a lovely field activity indeed!
